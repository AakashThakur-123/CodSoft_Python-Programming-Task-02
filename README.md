# Task-02 CALCULATOR :- Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display the result.

# Task 2 (Calculator)
We developed a basic Calculator application using Tkinter and input field, buttons and for the calculation purpose we will use logic in our code defined in functions, like if you want to add two numbers then behind this there must be a logic for addition purpose, similarly for substraction, multiplication, etc, we have created functions whose task is to perform these operations.

There are a variety of functions in Tkinter with the help of them it becomes easy and convenient to make a simple calculator just with this little code.
Apart from the Tkinter widgets, we have defined the following functions in our code:

btn_click() Function: This function handles the button click on various numeric buttons to add them to the operation.

bt_clear() Function: This function is used to handle the clear operation to clean the previous input in the Calculator application.

bt_equal() Function: This function is used to handle the equal button to execute the operation and show the result.
